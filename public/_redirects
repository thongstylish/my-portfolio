This file will contain the rule below. It indicates that all requests to the server should be redirected to index.html. We also add a HTTP status code option at the end to indicate that these redirects should return a 200 status. By default, a 301 status is returned.

/*  /index.html 200

The last thing we have to do is add the below option in our angular.json und er projects > {your_project_name} > architect > options > assets. Include it in the assets array:

{
  "glob": "_redirects",
  "input": "src",
  "output": "/"
}
